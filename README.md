# User and Contact Service Microservices

This project consists of microservices designed to manage user and contact information. The system includes a **User Service** for managing user accounts and a **Contact Service** for managing user-specific contacts. These microservices are orchestrated using **Eureka** for service discovery and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for API gateway and load balancing.

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Register new users with an HTTP POST request.
  - Retrieve user details by user ID.
  - Update and delete users (future enhancements).

- **Contact Management**:
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete contacts associated with specific users.
  - Retrieve all contacts for a user or search for contacts by name.

- **API Gateway with Load Balancing**:
  - Uses Spring Cloud Gateway to route and load-balance requests across microservices.
  - Standardized API paths for easy integration and maintenance.

- **Service Discovery with Eureka**:
  - Eureka Server for discovering and managing microservices, allowing easy scaling and dynamic service registration.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Main programming language.
- **Spring Boot** - Framework for creating standalone applications.
- **Spring Cloud** - Used for microservices infrastructure.
  - **Spring Cloud Eureka** - For service discovery.
  - **Spring Cloud Gateway** - For API routing and load balancing.
- **Spring Data JPA** - For data access and persistence.
- **MySQL** - Relational database used to store user and contact data.
- **Lombok** - Reduces boilerplate code for Java objects.
- **Docker** (optional) - For containerization and deploying services consistently.

## Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture:
- **User Service**: Handles all user-related functionalities.
- **Contact Service**: Manages contacts associated with each user.
- **Eureka Server**: Manages service registration and discovery.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to the appropriate service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or higher**
- **MySQL Database** (or modify the configuration to use another database)
- **Maven** for building the project
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set up the MySQL Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database for the User Service and Contact Service.
   - Update `application.properties` in both services to reflect your database configurations.

3. **Run Eureka Server**:
   ```bash
   cd eureka-server
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Run User and Contact Services**:
   In separate terminals, navigate to each service directory and run:
   ```bash
   cd user_service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   ```bash
   cd contact_service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Run the API Gateway**:
   ```bash
   cd api-gateway
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. Access the **Eureka Dashboard** at `http://localhost:8761` to view registered services.

### API Endpoints

The following endpoints are exposed by the API Gateway (assuming the gateway is running on `localhost:8080`):

#### User Service

- **Register User**: `POST /api/v1/users/register`
- **Get User by ID**: `GET /api/v1/users/{id}`

#### Contact Service

- **Create Contact**: `POST /api/v1/contacts/{userId}`
- **Get Contact by ID**: `GET /api/v1/contacts/{userId}/{contactId}`
- **Update Contact**: `PUT /api/v1/contacts/{userId}/{contactId}`
- **Delete Contact**: `DELETE /api/v1/contacts/{userId}/{contactId}`
- **Get All Contacts for a User**: `GET /api/v1/contacts/{userId}/all`
- **Search Contacts by Name**: `GET /api/v1/contacts/{userId}/contacts/by-name/{name}`
